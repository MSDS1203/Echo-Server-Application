## Chat Application

This project is a chat application, it is made to specifically faciliate a chat between a server and a client. They may continue sending messages to one another until one party chooses to opt out. 

# How to run: 

# Server side
You must first run the Server.py file, this can be done by clicking "run without debugging"
The first thing that the user is prompted to do, is either press enter for "localhost" or enter in an ip they have in mind. If the ip entered is invalid, the program will tell alert the user. 
The server port is also requested. Once again, if you have a port in mind, you may enter it. If you would like a default port, simply press enter. 
Next a username is asked of the user, enter anything you would like. 

# Client side 
The client side can only be run after running the server, meaning please complete the first instruction before moving on.
#You may then press run on the Client.py file, and you will be prompted similar information. It might be preferable to choose different usernames of course. 

# How to exit 

A party may opt out specifically be when "end" is sent entered in. Otherwise, the chat will continue for as long as both parties want to participate

Resources used within the project included websites instructing on python documentation as well as resources for better structuring a ReadMe.
